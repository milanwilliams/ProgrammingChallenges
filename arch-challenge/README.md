# Background

“The marketing intelligence platform that makes your data more meaningful.” is the catchphrase for PMG’s premier marketing platform, Alli. 

In order to do this deceptively simple task, Alli has to process terabytes of client data from a plethora of sources each and every day. This data is used to gain insights and drive client marketing strategies as well as small tweaks in ad spend.  In order to be most effective, multiple transformations need to be applied to the data, insights gathered, and actions generated ASAP. A further complication is there is no dependable pattern of how much time will each step in the process take. 

# Problem Statement

1. In a modern modular system, different components (e.g. APIs) collaborate to perform a complex activity. These subsystems have to communicate with each other to signal the status of their portions of the work. This is further complicated with the fact that as systems evolve, new components are added or removed. 

1. Generate an interface that represents a "message" between systems that will have varying concrete implementations. Your code will include a way to “listen to a message” and “return status code”.

1. How will the parts of this system communicate those messages? Please produce some sort of diagram,  topology overview, or text describing this.

1. How would you go about deploying this platform in a public cloud of your choice (describe your methodology and choice of tooling in 1+ paragraphs).

1. How would you go about chunking this massive software into phases (what Minimally Viable Products would you create?). (1+ paragraphs describing at least 2 MVPs).

1. How do you divide up tasks that can be delegated to other developers on the team should they be available (1+ paragraphs describing a simple project plan)?
